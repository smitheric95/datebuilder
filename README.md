1. Download vagrant
2. run "vagrant up" in terminal

Optionally, you can change the OSX host file (Google it)

some useful vagrant commands:
vagrant up: gets vagrant up and running - run when you're about to develop
vagrant halt: saves state up the machine - run when you're done developing
vagrant destroy: destroys the machine - run when things aren't working

# DateBuilder 

## A Dating Site for WHAT not WHO
## A running version of this application can be found at datebuilder.club

### About
This project was a collaboration among four students - two on the frontend (Tyler and Eric) and two on the backend (Jake and Henry).
It was created through a human-centered design process to target young bachelor's like ourselves!

Instead of finding a person to date, DateBuilder helps users plan and organize dates. It includes features to help people keep cost of location, time, and money.

Never again will a waiter say, "Didn't you bring a different girl here last week?"

### Build and Run
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
2. Navigate to datebuilder in terminal and run "vagrant up"
3. Open "192.168.50.4" in browser


Some useful vagrant commands:
vagrant up: gets vagrant up and running - run when you're about to develop
vagrant halt: saves state up the machine - run when you're done developing
vagrant destroy: destroys the machine - run when things aren't working
